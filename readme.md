## Memory Game with Vue

A short challenge I am issueing to myself. Can I teach myself a new framework by ONLY reading the documentation. No video tutorials or forum help allowed!

In 2018, I went through the Udacity Front End Nano Degree program, and as part of said program, I had to build a memory game. Since then, I have redone the project using React. I am now going to try to teach myself a new framework only using algorithms from the previous projects and the new framework's documentation.
